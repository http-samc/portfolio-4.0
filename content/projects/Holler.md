## What I learned?
I made this app with React Native. This was my first time dealing with an app that required real-time updates. Fortunately, using the Firebase Web SDK, I was able to leverage React hooks to create a seamless experience. For my web deployment, I specified some separate components using regular React libraries (when universal options were not possible) using the `*.js` and `*.native.js` schemas.
